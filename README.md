# IT352-Pattern-Recognition-Assignments
 Implementation of some algorithms taught in the Pattern Recognition course

- **MNIST Dataset Digit Recognizer**
Digit Recognition using Keras and Tensorflow by calculating centroid and euclidean distance

- **FMD Dataset Texture Classifier**
Classification of [Flickr Material Database (FMD)](https://people.csail.mit.edu/lavanya/fmd.html) using texture measures from Gray-Level Co-occurence Matrix (GLCM)  
Yields low results but can be improved by taking multiple distances and angles for glcm matrix for each instance

- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (Built-in vs From Scratch) on IRIS Dataset**
Implementation of LDA on the non-linear [IRIS](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) dataset against sklearn-lda
